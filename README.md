I am **SveÅ¥a**, passionate self-taught full stack web (or sometimes mobile) developer at company **KompilÃ¡tor**. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces and safe code. I am joining data analyse, architecture, UI and coding experience during product development.

I am also an open-source enthusiast. I learned a lot from the open-source Python community. I also have a lot of own ideas, that i want to always develop.
